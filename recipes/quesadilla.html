    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Breakfast quesadillas are the easiest one-pan breakfast and take just minutes to make. Change up the egg
        quesadillas with your favorite protein.
    </p>
    <p>
        This recipe is incredibly easy to make, so it's great for days when you don't have a lot of time to make
        breakfast for yourself. Try adding some spinach if you're feeling frisky. I've
        never done it but I'm curious as to how it would turn out.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 flour tortilla 8‚Äù in diameter</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 Pinch salt and pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 cup shredded Mexican cheese</li>
        <li>3-4oz of breakfast protein (sausage, ham, bacon, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a non-stick pan over medium heat. Cook Sausage or Bacon until browned and cooked through then remove to
            a plate. If using cooked ham, you can heat it up or just add it over
            the cheese in step 4. Wipe excess oil from skillet if needed. Reduce heat to low.</li>
        <li>In a measuring cup, add 2 eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper, or add seasoning to taste. Beat with a fork.
            Add beaten eggs and swirl to spread evenly over the bottom of the pan.
            Cook over low heat until When eggs are nearly cooked through (if you tilt the pan they shouldn't run).</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the top with 2 Tbsp shredded cheese then cover with a tortilla. The cheese will make the tortilla
            stick to the egg. Use a large spatula to get under the egg and quickly
            flip over.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle another 2 Tbsp of cheese or add cheese to taste. Sprinkle your cooked protein (sausage, bacon or
            ham) over half of the surface and fold the tortilla in half. Sautee on
            both sides until golden brown.* Remove from skillet and use a pizza cutter to cut quesadilla into wedges and
            serve warm.</li>
    </ol>
