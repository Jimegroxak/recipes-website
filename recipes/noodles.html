    <h2>Description</h2>
    <div class="description">
        <p>
            An incredibly simple noodle stir fry recipe. Great for college kids
            or anyone trying to eat on a budget. Cheaper than anything you could
            get for takeout, and also far cheaper!
        </p>
        <p>
            Any kind of noodle can work, but egg noodles are preferred over something
            like spaghetti. Pork is optional, so this can easily be converted to a
            vegetarian dish as well.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup chili garlic sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 lb. ground pork(optional)</li>
        <li>2 3oz. packages ramen noodles</li>
        <li>3 green onions, sliced</li>
        <li>1/4 cup unsalted peanuts, chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the chili garlic sauce, soy sauce, and brown sugar in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Add the ground pork to a skillet and cook over medium heat until it is fully browned*. Once browned, add the
            prepared dragon sauce and chopped peanuts. Allow the pork and peanuts to
            simmer in the sauce for another 5 minutes, or until the sauce has reduced by half.</li>
        <li>While the pork is browning, begin boiling water for your noodles. Once boiling, add your noodles and cook
            according to the package directions. Drain the noodles in a colander.</li>
        <li>Once the sauce has reduced and the noodles have drained, add the noodles to the skillet and toss until
            everything is combined and coated in sauce. Top with sliced green onions and
            serve!</li>
    </ol>
